Simple format for new item:

    * Year, Company or Product Name, Article title, The link to the article

If there is a link to Hacker News, please add them at the end

    * Year, Company or Product Name, Article title, The link to the article, The link to Hacker New post

If possible please use the official link/article of the company. In the
commit subject, please use the simple format: `Year, Company/Product, Short title.`

Note: the second field (`Company/Product Name`) is more about the subject
in the article, not the object of them. For example, when an engineer `Mr. X`
left a company `Y`, we would expect the new item as below

```
* 2020, Mr. X, Why I left company Y
```
